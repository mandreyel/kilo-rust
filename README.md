# kilo-rust

## What
This is a small educational project whereby I (try to) implement a basic text editor by porting [antirez's kilo editor](https://github.com/antirez/kilo) to Rust.

## Why
I thought this might be a sufficiently interesting yet not too overwhelming first project while reading the amazing [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/second-edition/) and learning Rust.

In the unlikely case that someone should ever read the code, I humbly ask you, dear unlikely person, that if you find anything that merits constructive critcism, please don't hesitate to share it, e.g. by opening an issue. It would be highly appreciated!

## Disclaimer
There are no plans to develop it beyond achieving basic functionality and familiarizing myself with Rust.
